# Spevents: Making Every Event Unforgettable

## Pitch
#### What is Spevents?
Spevents is a QR-based photo sharing platform that lets event guests contribute to a real-time 3D photo gallery without downloading an app.

#### Problem
At weddings and events, guests are constantly switching between enjoying moments and trying to capture them. Traditional solutions like hashtags scatter photos across platforms, while "upload your photos" websites get low engagement. Custom event apps have high friction and low adoption.

#### Solution
Guests scan a QR code at their table, take photos through our web interface, and swipe up to share. Photos instantly appear in a 3D visualization of the venue that's displayed during the event. No app downloads, no accounts, no friction.

#### Market
$70B wedding industry in the US, with 2.2M weddings annually. Initial focus on Vanderbilt University's 350+ reservable venues and Nashville's wedding market.

#### Traction
- Launching at Mock Shaadi wedding event with 300 guests in partnership with 3 cultural organizations
- Pre-launch interest from --

#### Business Model
- Free tier for small events (up to 100 guests)
- Premium tier with usage-based pricing ($29 base + storage costs)
- Enterprise plans for venues and event planners
- Infrastructure costs tied directly to AWS usage
- 70% margins after cloud storage and processing costs

#### Team
Solo founder with CS/Math background + event planning experience. Built venue management systems and organized multiple cultural events.

#### Ask
Looking for $500K to expand venue partnerships and develop premium features. Currently have $50K committed from angel investors.
